#### Courses

<ul>
<li><div style="text-align:justify"><p>	<strong>Medical Biochemistry 1</strong>: The Medical Biochemistry I course introduces the fundamental aspects of biological chemistry from both a biochemical and medical perspective. The course overviews the structure, function, and metabolism of biological molecules: carbohydrates, fatty acids, proteins and nucleic acids. We also evaluate in detail enzyme kinetics, including their activation, inhibition, and allosteric interactions in metabolic pathways of biological molecules and other physiological processes, as well as in the flow of genetic information. Students learn to elaborate on specific biochemical pathways and how they interface with human physiology and diseases, including disease etiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Not less important will be describing and applying biochemical concepts and techniques into diseases diagnosis and current scientific research.</p></div></li> 
</ul>

<ul>
<li><div style="text-align:justify"><p>	<strong>Medical Biochemistry 2</strong>: The Medical Biochemistry 2 course builds on the concepts learned in Medical Biochemistry 1 to apply the chemistry of biomolecules from a tissue-specific and clinical standpoints. The course overviews the function and metabolism of biological molecules (e.g carbohydrates, fatty acids, proteins and nucleic acids) at specific tissues and diseases. Students implement higher levels of learning and knowledge dimmensions to analyze clinical scenarios, evaluate possible biochemical outcomes, and how to address biochemical defficiency or malfunctions.. As with Medical Biochemistry 1, students also elaborate on specific biochemical pathways and how they interface with human physiology and diseases, including disease etiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Not less important will be describing and applying biochemical concepts and techniques into diseases diagnosis and current scientific research. .</p></div></li> 
</ul>

<ul>
<li><div style="text-align:justify"><p>	<strong>Immunology</strong>: This course presents fundamental concepts of immunology and role of the immune system in health and disease, the use of serological and antibody-based methods in the clinical lab. A review of the biological effects of immunologic reactions, antibody formation and interactions, and immunological specificity of normal and diseased cells and tissues will be discussed.</p></div></li> 
</ul>

<ul>
<li><div style="text-align:justify"><p>	<strong>Molecular Genetics</strong>: This course discusses the genetic influences that affect the course of human development from reproduction through the prenatal, neonatal, pediatric, adolescent, and adults periods. Screening protocol, gene therapy, and new treatment modalities are covered including pharmacogenetics and epigenetics..</p></div></li> 
</ul>

<li><div style="text-align:justify"><p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.31839.66721">Correct/Incorrect Ratio in Staining Techniques in Microbiology Lab</a>: This data analysis report evaluated the proportion of correct answers in two Microbiology Lab sections during a practical session of staining techniques: Gram stain, Acid-fast stain, Endospore stains At the moment of elaborating this report, I am currently teaching these two microbiology lab sessions at Miami Dade College. Students were given two unknown bacteria for which they had to implement the Gram stain, Acid-fast stain, and Endospore stain, in addition to describing the unknown bacteria's cell shape and arrangement. After the students submitted their answers, the data was gathered and organized with the following variables: microbiology lab course section (sections A and B to not disclosed the actual section number), table where they sit in the lab (each table has four students), gender, and responses (correct as 1, and incorrect as 0) answers in shape, cell arrangement, Gram stain, Acid-fast stain, and Endospore stain.

<li><div style="text-align:justify"><p><a href="http://rpubs.com/friveramariani/bsc1005_20163">Data Analysis in a General Education Biology Course after the First Summative</a>:This report converge a data analysis of the General Education course taught during the term summer term (2016-3) of the academic year 2016-2017. This course is administered to non-science majors, most of whom are freshman and sophomore students, in a web-enhanced format through Blackboard LearnTM at Miami Dade College. In this data analysis report, which was performed just after exam 1 was administered (out three to be administered in the course), addressed the following questions:</p></div></li> 
</ul>

 + How does exam 1 scores compare to scores in formative assessments (quizzes, polling questions, and reading assignments)?
 + How many students had a higher score in exam 1 compared to their mean Quizzes scores?
 + Which question, topic, bt, kd, and format had the lowest proportion of correct answers?
 + Is there a relationship between formative (quizzes, ra, reef) and exam 1?
 + If there was relationship, which formative assessment had more predictive power of the exam1 grades?
 + Is there a relationship between attendance and exam 1?
 + Is there a relationship between attendance and quizzes?
 + How does the proportion of corrects differ between assessments?

<li><div style="text-align:justify"><p><a href="http://rpubs.com/friveramariani/genbioed_survey">Data Analysis on a Survey Administered to Students on the First Day of Class in a General Education Biology Course</a>: This data analysis report evaluates the responses of a survey, which was administered to students (through Blackboard Learn) on the first day of the General Education Biology (BSC1005) course at Miami Dade College during the 2016-2 term (Fall 2016-2017 semester). After students completed the survey, which contain 8 questions (refer to Questions in the Survey below), the raw data was downloaded from Blackboard Learn into a local directory. The file with the raw data was saved as Microsoft ExcelTM file. For questions with character (i.e. word) responses, such as question 1, 7 and 8, the most frequent words as well as the total words per student’s responses were determined. For the remaining questions, the proportion of answers was determined.</p></div></li>

<li><div style="text-align:justify"><p><a href="http://rpubs.com/friveramariani/ml2010L153">Relationship between Formative Assessments (i.e. low-stake quizzes, reading assignment, polling questions) and a Summative Assessment (i.e. Midterm Exam) in a Introductory Microbiology Lab Course</a>: This data analysis report evaluate **relationships between formative assessments (i.e. low-stake quizzes, reading assignments, and in-class polling questions) and a summative assessment (i.e. Midterm Exam) in a Introductory Microbiology Lab Course. In addition, scores in a Pre-Test summative assessment administered the first day of class were compared to those of the Midterm Exam. Similar types of data analysis have been carry out in courses that I have taught at Miami Dade College with the main goals of identifying areas that students may be struggling and/or learning practices that may need to be modified. In addition, comparing scores in earlier formative examinations with recent ones will provide an initial assessment into the students progress in the course.</p></div></li>

As professors, we often rely on one-on-one student assessment. This may limit us in identifying shared misconceptions within a classroom because we are evaluating them based on just a few individual attempts technique. In this study, peer-assessment was used as an intervention to identify shared students' misconceptions and interpretation errors in the streak plate method. From a broth with a mixed culture of two bacteria, students from two different microbiology lab sections performed the streak plate method on four nutrient agar plates. After the corresponding incubation period, students peer-assessed streaked plates, and the scores compared with the professor's scores. Compared to the professor's mean scores, mean differences varied (i.e. under and over-estimations) in one microbiology lab section, while statistically significantly overestimated on the other. Therefore, these results suggest that students may share misconceptions when interpreting results from the streak plate method. Peer-assessment can be an intervention tool to identify misconceptions and interpretation errors with laboratory techniques, and corrective learning approaches developed and implemented accordingly.</p></div></li>
