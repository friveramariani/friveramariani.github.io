<p>“Tell me and I forget.  Teach me and I may remember.  Involve me and I learn.” </p>
-- Benjamin Franklin

<p>A good scientist does not becomes a mentor by default; a good teacher does not becomes a mentor by default. <b>Becoming a good mentor</b> involves developing a series of skillsets that go beyond simlpy telling and teaching someone:</p>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a name="Lorraine N. Vélez-Torres"></a><i><b>Lorraine Torres-Vélez (Ph.D. candidate - University of Puerto Rico - Medical Sciences Campus).</b></i>
Lorraine is a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Microbiology and Medical Zoology at the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus. She earned her master’s degree in Public Health with concentration in Epidemiology in 2015, identifying the risk factors affecting the quality of life of residents in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico. In 2014 she received a double major in Industrial Microbiology and Biology at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus. During her undergraduate education, she worked in the Symbiosis Laboratory of Dr. Cafaro investigating the antifungal capacity of Actinobacteria associated to the exoskeleton of the termite Nasutitermes costalis. She’s currently working in her research thesis at the Mycology Laboratory of Dr. Bolaños, studying the effect of Hurricane María in the indoor concentration of fungi and the health outcomes of the habitants.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Currently, she’s the President of the Microbiology Chapter of her campus where she promotes and organizes professional and educative outreach activities for the community. Outside academia, Lorraine enjoys dancing salsa, visiting new restaurants and kayaking.</p></div> 

<div style="text-align:justify"><p> Because Dr. Rivera-Mariani is a member of the thesis committee of Lorraine, she was invited for and completed a one-week training with the RIPLRT to learn the different human-based immunological approaches we implement in environmental health studies. Also, she trained on the experimental planning and design, project management and execution, as well as data management and analysis we implement when deploying human-based immunological approaches to study the respiratory health risks resulting from human exposures to air pollution. Lorraine will be implementing in her thesis studies the skill sets she will learned with the RIPLRT.</p></div>

She completed a Bachelor degree in Microbiology at the University of Puerto Rico in Humacao. During her undergraduate years, she had the opportunity to participate in research investigations trying to isolate potential antimicrobial producing bacterias and nitrogen fixing bacterias. She was part of the Student Microbiology Chapter and the American Student Medical Association. Right now, Xaymara is a third year graduate student at University Of Puerto Rico-Medical and Science Campus. She is completing a M.S. in Microbiology and Medical Zoology. Currently, she is working on her thesis project  at the Mycology Laboratory of Dr. Benjamin Bolanos. Her thesis investigations focus on investigating the role of aeroallergens such as pollen and fungal spores in the susceptibility to acquired Covid-19. </p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>During the past three years, she had the opportunity to collaborate in the project "Taking a breath after Hurricane Maria" taking air samples from water damaged houses and identifying fungus captured from the air samples.  Also, she is working in analyzing data from air samples captured from houses located in the community of Pinones in Loiza, Puerto Rico.  Currently, she is part of the directive of the Microbiology Chapter at the UPR-RCM and is the representative of the master students at the graduate committee.  Besides academia, Xaymara enjoys exercising, doing road trips and reading. She pursues to continue graduate studies.</p></div>
