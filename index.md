<p>Dear readers, I am <b><i>Dr. Rivera-Mariani</i></b>, and I have expertise in immunology, microbiology, aerobiology and computational biology. I employ these expertise to study the immunological and molecular mechanisms that participate in the respiratory health risks from exposure, at different environmental settings, to different airborne biological pollutants of different chemical origins. I am also an <b><i>Assistant Professor and Academic Coordinator</i></b> within the <a href="http://ularkin.org/college-of-biomedical-sciences/" target="_blank">College of Biomedical Sciences at Larkin University</a>, where I teach biochemistry, immunology, and molecular genetics. I am also the Principal Investigator of the <a href="https://www.riplrt.com/" target="_blank">Respiratory and Immunology Project and Laboratory</a> at Larkin University, and Founder of the science communication/outreach initiative <a href="https://www.vistazoalaciencia.com/" target="_blank">A Glance at the Science</a>.</p>

<p>Among my academic credentials include a <i>B.S. in Biology with minor in Chemistry</i> (Southeastern Louisiana University under an athletic scholarship), <i>Ph.D. in Microbiology and Medical Zoology</i> (School of Medicine of the University of Puerto Rico - Medical Sciences Campus), <i>Post-doctoral fellowship in Environmental Health Sciences</i> (the Bloomberg School of Public Health of the Johns Hopkins University), and <i>Science Teaching Fellowship</i> (American Society for Microbiology).</p>

<p>I am also a strong supporter of reproducibility in sciences, and thus have gained specializations in <i>Data Science, Genomic Data Sciences, Executive Data Science, Software Development</i> (Johns Hopkins University), <i>Systems Biology</i> (Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai), and <i>Bioinformatics</i> (University of California at San Diego). Through these specializations, I have developed extensive experience as a programmer in the R, Python, and Matlab computer languages.</p>
