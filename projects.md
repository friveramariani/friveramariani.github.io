<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a href="https://friveramariani.github.io/RIPL_Effect/" target="_blank">Respiratory and Immunology Project at Larkin University</a>: Our primary scientific goal is to provide further insight into the immuno-physiological health effects that airborne pollutants of different chemical origins induce once they cross the human respiratory barrier among susceptible individuals (e.g., people who have asthma, respiratory allergies, and other chronic respiratory conditions). We seek to address our scientific questions by integrating human-based immuno-physiological approaches, molecular biology, and computational biology.</p></div>

**Big Data analysis in Biological Sciences and Public Health**

<div style="text-align:justify"><p>Understanding the biological mechanisms that participate in human disease and designing intervention strategies to promote better human helth rely on evidence-based approaches. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" target="_blank">Big Data analysis</a> in biological sciences aligns with one of the requirements of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4589117/" target="_blank">Bradford Hill</a> criteria for disease causation. Thefore, in this category of projects, I share <b>computational approaches</b> applied into the interphase of biological sciences to understand human health, and environmental health sciences approaches to prevent or limit incidence of human disease.</p></div> 

<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a href="https://github.com/friveramariani/GenomicDataScience_FetalAdultBrain" target="_blank">Differential in Gene Expression between Fetal and Adult Brains</a>: In this genomic data science project, the goal was to evaluate differences in gene expression between fetal and adult brains. Transcriptome sequencing data (known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq" target="_blank">RNA-seq</a>) for this genomic data science project was sequenced on an Illumina platform from human post-mortem brains. The raw sequencing data and meta-data related to each brain sample was retrieved from a public database. The data was aligned, quality control performed on the alignments, and gene count levels of expression quantified. With the aid of exploratory and fitting statistical models,  patterns of gene expression were identified between fetus and adult brains. Findings from this genomic data science project provided insights into genes differentially expressed between fetus and adult brains that helps understand human development, and represents an example of reproducible research in genomic sciences.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a href="https://github.com/friveramariani/Proteomic-Examples" target="_blank">Example of Proteomic Analysis of Ovarian Cancer</a>: This example proteomic data analysis, performed in the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html" target="_blank">Matlab</a> computer language, analyzed SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry from blood samples of two groups: ovarian cancer  vs control group. In this example, Matlab scripts are presented to pre-process the data, generate plots of the groups' spectrograms as well as ranking features using a two-way t-statistic. The data analyzed in this example was obtained from the <a href="https://home.ccr.cancer.gov/ncifdaproteomics/ppatterns.asp" target="_blank">FDA-NCI Clinical Proteomics Program</a>.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/project/Airborne-fungal-allergens-and-their-role-in-the-incidences-of-chronic-respiratory-diseases" target="_blank">Molecular Characterization of Aeroallergens Endemic in the Atmosphere of Puerto Rico</a>: This project, in collaborations with colleagues at the Department of Microbiology in the School of Medicine, of the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) represents our efforts to contribute to improve allergy diagnosis and reduce the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4554327/" target="_blank">high incidence of chronic respiratory disease in my homeland of Puerto Rico</a>. Because there are endemic aeroallergens in the atmosphere of Puerto Rico (find related studies <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/project/Airborne-fungal-allergens-and-their-role-in-the-incidences-of-chronic-respiratory-diseases" target="_blank">here</a>) for which there are no commercial extracts to perform allergy testing, identifying the causative agents of episodes of chronic respiratory allergies among susceptible individuals has been difficult in Puerto Rico. Since 2005, together with Dr. Benjamin Bolaños-Rosero and his graduate students, and other collegues within the UPR university system, we have been working on providing insights of the immunoreactivity and toxicology, and aerobiology of these aeroallergens and characterizing them through immunological and molecular biology approaches.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p><strong>Statistical Approaches to Study the Aerobiology Airborne Allergens</strong>: In recent collaborative studies with colleagues from Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Spain, we have been working on generating statistical and predictive models on concentrations of aeroallegens based on meteorological predictors in Cuba and Puerto Rico. Findings from these collaborations will yield additional insights into the aerobiology and predictive models  of aeroallergens in the Caribbean region, and contribute to our efforts to further characterize endemic allergens in the Caribbean atmosphere and reduce the high incidence of chronic respiratory diseases in the Caribbean basin.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><p><a href="http://www.friveram.com/PRCubeStars/">Citizen Science Project to Design Assemble and Program a Miniature Satellite</a>: Fungal spores, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/project/Airborne-fungal-allergens-and-their-role-in-the-incidences-of-chronic-respiratory-diseases" target="_blank">which are known to pose human respiratory health risks (e.g. respiratory allergies, asthma)</a>, are important contributors to the Microbiome particularly in the troposphere. Less is known about their potential to contribute to stratospheric Microbiome. The current research seeks to design a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat" target="_blank">CubeSat</a> with a Removable Specimen Collector to determine if allergenic fungal spores can reach the stratosphere. Air samples will be collected at ground, troposphere, and stratosphere levels through a Removable Specimen Collector designed within a CubeSat, which will be carried up through the different layers of the atmosphere by the <a href="http://www.perlanproject.org/" target="_blank">Perlan II glider</a>.  The design and performance of the CubeSat hardware will be optimized through preliminary experimentation prior to launch. Through optical microscopy and image analysis, the concentration of fungal spores per cubic meter of air and proportions of specific fungal spore types will be determined and compared between the ground level, troposphere, and stratosphere levels. Our expected findings will provide insights into the contribution of allergenic fungal spores to the stratospheric Microbiome, and thus the potential of allergenic fungal spores to engage in long-distance travel through the upper layers of the atmosphere.</p></div>
