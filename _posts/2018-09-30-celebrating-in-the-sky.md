subtitle: My darling wife and myself skydiving in our anniversary!

What else can a crazy couple do to celebrate their 2nd-year wedding anniversary: jump from an airplane at 14,000 feet, and free falling @120mph! During our anniversary weekend, she surprised me with one of the items in our to-do list: skydiving. 

*Awesome experience and many more jumps to come in the near future (for both of us)!!!*
