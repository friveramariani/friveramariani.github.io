What else can a crazy couple do to celebrate their 2nd-year wedding anniversary: jump from an airplane at 14,000 feet, and free falling @120mph. During our anniversary weekend, she surprised my by one of the items in our to-do list: skydiving. 

*Awesome experiences and many more jumps to come in the near future (for both of use)!!!*
